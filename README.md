Several things we need for sure

UI/UX Creation
Native App Development - IOS/Android
Backend (IE. Server/Database Setup)
Chat Bot Integration (Comprehend Language)
Personal Profile (Each individual user)
QA Engineering to test product

Features list

- User personal profiles
Personal information such as age, gender, and a photo.
The Dialect from the specific area that the user wants to learn. Try to offer as many City-specific dialects as possible.
Daily goal. Let users set a goal for how many minutes a day they want to study.

Dialectlevel. Some users might know the basics of a dialect, while some might know nothing and your app is their first introduction to the language.

Provide a test to show which level users should start with.

Courses
- The Courses feature includes the option for users to learn daily, weekly, or monthly.

Lessons
- Translate an audio phrase. (The user is given an audio phrase in the foreign dialect, its written variant, and an image that illustrates its meaning. The task is to compose a translation of the given words by dragging them into the correct places.)
-Select the picture. The app shows the user a few pictures with short descriptions in the dialect being studied. The user’s task is to choose the picture that answers the question (for example, Which of these is a boy?).
-Competitive multple choice game (Best of 5 correct answers win) (This has to be against other users like words with friends) (Invite a friend to play with them)
-How do you say? The user is provided with a few words out of which they need to compose a specified phrase.
-Select the missing word. The app shows a phrase that’s missing a word, and the user needs to supply the word that’s omitted.
-Translate and record. This type of lesson requires access to a microphone. The user is given a phrase in their native language and needs to translate it aloud. This type of lesson is perfect for mastering pronunciation.
-Prompts. The user can tap any highlighted word and the app will show them hints: translation, use cases, etc.

Social media sharing

- A Dashboard: each user has a dashboard where users can monitor their achievements:

Day streaks. This shows the user’s progress during the day: completed tasks, goal achievements, etc.
Gambix Tokens. The app awards users with coins called Gambix tokens that they can use to buy things in the Duolingo shop.

The Health feature is one of the things that makes this stand out from the crowd.
When studying something new, mistakes are inevitable. Dialekt not only awards users when they succeed but punishes them for failure to inspire them to try harder.
For each mistake the user makes, the app takes away virtual health. When the Health level drops to zero, users cannot continue without working on their mistakes. Health regenerates over time.

Clubs
Clubs is a feature that helps users interact with each other. Users can create their own clubs or join existing ones. To do so, all they need to do is tap on Find me a club.
This feature makes people get placed in groups based on their city.

Shop
The app has a Shop feature that lets users turns coins they’ve collected during training into actual purchases. If users don’t have enough coins to buy what they want, they can buy coins for real-world money.

Custom push notifications with history tidbits about language and dialect

Must-Haves
A simple and engaging UI/UX. This app focuses on making the user experience fun and engaging. Exercises include speaking, listening, and communication tasks.

Gamification:
Gamification means building the learning process around solving puzzles and quests and getting rewards. We want this incorporated at every step of the user-experience

Chatbot

Colors- Green, black and purple

Feedback of designs
Here is some feedback. On the screens, for the app, we would like the images in the app to reflect some of the main ideas of the app. For example, interview prep (someone is trying to go for a job interview and they want to improve their grammar and verbiage via the app. Other use cases would be if someone is planning to travel to a new city they would use the app to brush up on the lingo.

This can be reflected in images throughout the app. Or well-placed text.

Based on feedback few screens were modified , Modified screens are :
